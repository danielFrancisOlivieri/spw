After routing the opposing cavalry, Masinissa’s men turned around and charged into the Carthaginian infantry’s rear. This action proved decisive and won Zama—and the war—for Rome.

Finding the price too high, Superbus refused. Sibyl then threw three of the books into the fire. She then offered to sell the remaining six to Superbus for the same price. He again refused and she again threw three books into the fire. She then offered to sell Superbus the last three books for the same price she had originally offered for all nine. Impressed with her tenacity, Superbus accepted. These three books were kept closely guarded under the temple of Jupiter in Rome. The Roman senate would consult them in times of great danger. Fabius Maximus ordered them to be consulted as soon as he ascended to the dictatorship.`,
